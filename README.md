### freeCodeCamp Calculator project

Here is my solution of [this freeCodeCamp challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator).
To try out this app on your local machine you can clone this repo and then run `npm install` to install all the dependencies but you should have installed Node.js and Node Package Manager.

You can also try it out using [this CodePen](https://codepen.io/chronic1613/pen/OJRjOeG) and see this app is passing all the required user stories and tests.

No extra dependencies (in addition to CRA dependencies) required.

Although this code passes all user stories and tests it can have some bugs with rounding numbers in decimals.
This will be fixed in the following commits :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
